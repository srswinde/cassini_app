# The Cassini Database

## Cassini
Cassini is a sulcata tortoise who lives in my backyard.

There are many pictures of cassini floating around the internet. Mostly the ones I posted on his [website](https://swahle.org/cassini/detections.html?date=Wed%20Feb%2005%202025).

This app is an attempt to leverage that website to create a database of cassini images in a kubernets cluster. It uses lazy loading and a process server to pull the cassini images from his website and store them in a database managed by a kubernetes cluster.
